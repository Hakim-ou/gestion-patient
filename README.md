# gestion-patient

A Java application for patient management in a dental clinic. In the beginning, my objective was to collect data about how much time doctors spend with a patient
for another project that needs time estimation. I tried to make it useful for doctors so I could find people that would accept to participate in this study.
Later I discovered that there are so many things a doctor could find in a software, so I decided to extend the project to patient management. So this is only a first version of it that manages only patient records.

I am currently working in a team with a friend on the next level of this app. The new version is very promising that we decided not to make the source code
public in order to commercialize this software. If you have some ideas about features that you, or someone you know, would like to find in our application please
contact me on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/hakim-ou-340038191/.
